# Problem of Measuring "complexity"

## Base Complexity measure based on machine models

| Pro                             | Cons                               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ultimately machines are needed  | measure is not machine independent |
| easy, transparent and intuitive |                                    |
| historical, standard            |                                    |

- Investigate problems $\longleftrightarrow$ architectures
- "Textbook theory": consider only complexity precision up to polynomial relatedness

$$
TIME(f(n)) \subseteq TIME(f^k(n))
$$

$$
P = \bigcup_{k \geq 1} TIME_1(n^k) = \bigcup_{k \geq 1} TIME(n^k)
$$
